    <p>Hey Eric. 
      How's it going? Below is some info on the project I mentioned over the weekend. 
      <br><br>
      I'd like to organize a portfolio in an edition of 250 consisting of B & W copy works (Xerox copies) by 25 different artists on 8.5" x 11"  paper. 
      <br><br>
      Each artist will be asked to submit 25 copies plus an additional 250. The works will be colated into portfolios. The first 25 portfolios will be shared between the participating artists. The remaining 250 will form the edition. All copies will be signed in pencil. 
      <br><br>
      The medium will be limited to the copy itself, so as not to affect the other works.  The costs would be low. Printing through fed Ex online is 17 cents./sheet. They also deliver. If the artist feels comfortable walking into fed ex the rates are 13 cents per sheet. Local pharmacies and bodegas sometimes have copy machines too. 
      <br><br>
      I’ll keep the price low to reach a more diverse audience. Any profit will be shared equally. 
      <br><br>
      I still need to  come up with a working title that may serve as a prompt. 
      <br><br>
      One of the inspirations is Seth Siegelaub's The Xerox Book and also all the DIY zines and flyers etc I've seen over the years. 
      <br><br>
      I'm overwhelmed with the current language of crisis and the pandemic. I'd also, I'd like to find other ways of engaging with each other that are not limited to "online viewing" rooms. They aren't resonating with me. I’d like to cultivate tenderness and some reciprocity. I would like the portfolio to function as an reminder of ourselves during this time. A shared document among friends and fellow artists. 
      <br><br>
      Im asking different artist to participate, most who have a connection to New York mostly for logistical reasons. I'll invite a range of artists. I have 3 artists who are interested but wanted the idea to take a little more form before I reach out to other people. 
      <br><br>
      I thought of you cause I like the work you do. Always liked the directness and sometimes I find it intimate and twisted. Love to get your feedback on the form and if you have time and the inclination to participate, I'd welcome that. It could be something as simple as contributing the cover page, title, etc. I think you could make a manila folder look sexy. 
      <br><br>
      Stay safe, 
      <br>
      Carlos.
